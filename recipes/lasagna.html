    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This vegetarian lasagna recipe is my favorite dish to make for family and friends! 
        Filled with savory roasted vegetables, it's healthy and delicious.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>8 ounces cremini mushrooms, stemmed and quartered</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 medium zucchini, cut into ½-inch pieces</li>
        <li>½ medium yellow onion, cut into ½-inch pieces</li>
        <li>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>15 lasagna noodles*</li>
        <li>3 cups marinara sauce, 24 ounces</li>
        <li>3 cups fresh spinach</li>
        <li>2 cups grated low-moisture, part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup grated pecorino cheese</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves or chopped fresh parsley, for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Oil a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Place the mushrooms, red pepper, zucchini, and onion on the baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and toss to coat. Spread evenly on the baking sheet and roast for 20 to 25 minutes, or until tender and browned around the edges. Reduce the oven temperature to 400°F.    </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook the noodles.* Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and prepare the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions, cooking until al dente. Drain and toss with a drizzle of olive oil to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Make the ricotta filling: In a large bowl, stir together the ricotta, garlic, lemon zest, salt, and several grinds of pepper.</li>
        <li>Assemble the lasagna. Spread 1 cup of the marinara sauce at the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Top with a layer of noodles, followed by half the ricotta mixture. Spread the ricotta in an even layer, then arrange half the spinach evenly on top. Top with half the vegetables and dot with ⅔ cup of the remaining marinara sauce. </li>
        <li>Repeat with another layer of noodles, followed by the remaining ricotta, spinach, vegetables, and another ⅔ cup sauce. Top with the remaining noodles.</li>
        <li>Spread the remaining ⅔ cup marinara over the pasta, then evenly sprinkle with the mozzarella and pecorino cheeses. Bake in the 400°F oven for 30 minutes, or until the cheese is browned and bubbling. Let stand for 20 minutes before garnishing with fresh basil or parsley, slicing, and serving.</li>
    </ol>
