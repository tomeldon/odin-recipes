    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Learn how to make pancakes from scratch! This pancake recipe is easy 
        to make with simple ingredients and yields perfect fluffy pancakes every time.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1½ cups all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cane sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>1¼ cups milk, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly, or neutral oil, plus more for the pan</li>
        <li>Maple syrup, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and melted butter.</li>
        <li>Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. A few lumps are ok. If the batter is very thick, add milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, to loosen it slightly.</li>
        <li>Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat and brush lightly with butter or oil. Use a ⅓-cup scoop to pour the batter into the skillet. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes per side, or until the pancakes are puffed, golden brown, and cooked through in the middle. Turn the heat to low as needed so that the middles cook through without burning the outsides.</li>
        <li>Serve with maple syrup.</li>
    </ol>
