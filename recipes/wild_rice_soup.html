1 cup unsweetened almond milk
⅓ cup raw cashews
¼ cup cooked cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
2 tablespoons white miso paste
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
Soup
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

8 ounces cremini mushrooms, sliced

        Instructions
        Make the creamy base: Place the almond milk, cashews, white beans, miso paste, and Dijon mustard in a blender and process until smooth. Set aside.
        
        Make the soup: Heat the olive oil in a medium-large Dutch oven or large pot over medium heat. Add the scallions, celery, carrot, mushrooms, and salt and stir. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are tender, 8 to 10 minutes.
        Add the garlic, rosemary, thyme, cannellini beans, pepper, and water and stir. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes.
        Remove the thyme bundle and stir in the cashew mixture, rice, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and kale. Simmer over low heat until the kale is wilted, about 5 minutes. Season to taste and serve with more lemon juice, parsley and pinches of red pepper flakes, if desired.
